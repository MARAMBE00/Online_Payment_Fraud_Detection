# Online Payment Fraud Detection

This project explores **online payment fraud detection** using **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**, **Random Forest**, and **Decision Trees**. It is implemented in Python via Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

With the rise of e-commerce and online banking, fraud detection has become a critical challenge. This project evaluates and compares multiple machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* `Online Payment Fraud Detection.ipynb` â†’ Main notebook with literature review, model implementation, and evaluation.
* `dataset/` â†’ Contains the Kaggle dataset (not included here, link below).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset is from Kaggle:
ðŸ‘‰ [Online Payment Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection/data)

It contains records of online transactions with labels indicating **fraudulent (1)** or **genuine (0)**.
